Phase 2: POC Development â€“ Acceptance Criteria
    -> Dashboard Page:
        Displays key statistics using reusable card components with mock data or APIs.
        Utilizes higher-order functions (map, filter, reduce) for data processing.

    -> Products Page:
        Dynamic table with CRUD operations (Add, Edit, Delete, View in modal).
        Pagination, search, and filters for data management.

    -> React Hooks & State Management:
        Implements state handling with useState, useReducer, useContext.
        Uses React Router hooks (useLocation, useParams, useSearchParams) for navigation and filtering.
        Optimized performance using useMemo, useRef, and useCallback.

    -> Form Handling & Validation:
        Uses controlled components with useReducer for complex form state management.
        Ensures input validation for data accuracy.

    -> Optimized UI & Component Architecture:
        Modular, reusable components following best practices.
        Styled using Tailwind CSS or CSS Modules.
        Implements error handling and ensures a smooth UX.

Deliverables:
    -> Fully functional React POC project
    -> Clean, well-documented code
